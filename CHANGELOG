Release Notes - dpipe - Version v0.5.0.rc

** New Feature

    . EsOutput periodically report statistics
    . engine permits plugins to register HTTP REST api callback
    . cardinality output will export/reset counters through REST
    . replication from local logs to remote via TCP(compression TODO)
    . init.d script added
    . cardinality output uses gob to checkpoint state between restarts
    . config file validation and visualization[dpconf]
    . alarm when syslog-ng drops messages(ad-hoc parsers)

** Improvement

    . http monitoring with cmd: [ping, stat, plugins]
    . when timestamp is obviously invalid, correct it[als pkg]
    . report msg/s bytes/s
    . ES index patterns add support for ym/ymw/ymd
    . send alarm according to severity instead of accumulated lines num with priority queue
    . accumulate alarm email at night

** Bug

    . occasionally, EsOutput can't get EsIndex/EsType info
      [maybe] because SkyOutput matches all and because of race condition it recyles first

** Todo

    . Reload on HUP
    . faster json marshal/unmarshal, currently its 20000ns/op, that's 50K msg/s
